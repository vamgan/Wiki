# 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III

Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return _their lowest common ancestor (LCA)_.

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for `Node` is below:

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

According to the [**definition of LCA on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
* `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` exist in the tree.

**Solution:**

The question is asking us to find a common parent for the nodes p and q.

The basic approach here would be to get the path to root from one of the nodes and then try to go up from the other node and check which node is present in the path of the previous node. The first node to be common will be your lowest common ancestor

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        #Set to store the path from node p to root
        p_set = set()
        while p:
            p_set.add(p)
            p = p.parent
        
        while q:
            if q in p_set:
                return q
            q = q.parent
        return None
```

So what do you think would be the time and space complexity in the worst case for this approach?

Time Complexity: O(n) In the worst case if the node p is at the end of the left subtree and q at the end of the right subtree you will end up iterating through the complete tree as the common ancestor would be root.

Space Complexity: O(n) In the worst case the array will contain all the elements of a tree. if the p is the last node on the left side and q is the root node and there is no right subtree.&#x20;



### **What if we don't want to use space and do it in O(1) space?**

#### One pass -- sort of Time -> q + p

We can say there are two different paths: `q_path` and `p_path`

Instead of finding the length to root ahead of time, you can essentially create two equally sized, but different paths.

```
a_path = q_path + p_path
b_path = p_path + q_path
```

You can then iterate down each path until the pointers are the same. Then you have found your first common ancestor.

Here are the paths (from left to right) laid out. Where the two equal each other is the first common ancestor.

```
q_path = [2, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5]
p_path = [9, 8, 3, 4, 5]


a_path = [2, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 9, 8, 3, 4, 5]
b_path = [9, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5]
```

We don't have q\_path and p\_path as lists, but we do have each of their starting nodes, and that's all we need.

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        a_node = p
        b_node = q 
        
        while a_node != b_node:
            if a_node.parent: 
                a_node = a_node.parent
            else:
                a_node = q
            
            if b_node.parent:
                b_node = b_node.parent
            else:
                b_node = p
        return a_node
```
